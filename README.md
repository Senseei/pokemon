# pokemon
A pokemon fan-game in devellopment, the main goal is to make an entire battle system using python!
### 
I've been implementing the battle system so far, and it's not complete, most attacks that have effects may not work as expected..
The porpose here is to replicate a not perfect version of the pokemon's battle system, you all are welcome to try in if you want! <3
